# IQ Engines calling wrapper


*objectQuery()*: 	Send an image to the IQ Engines server, which will extract
				its visual content 
Parameters: Input image file name
Returns: Unique query id associated with the input image

*resultQuery()*: Requests classification information for an image using unique identifier
				 that was generated when posting the image initially
Parameters: Unique image indentifier
Returns: Currenly plain json response from the server, containing all the useful bits

## API endpoints
We currently use only the following calls:
     
*queryApi*: http://api.iqengines.com/v1.2/query/
docs: https://www.iqengines.com/apidocs/apis/query-api.html
    
*resultApi*:  http://api.iqengines.com/v1.2/result/  
docs https://www.iqengines.com/apidocs/apis/result-api.html
    
## API caveats
	1. Each API call should be associated with a unique api_sig hash
    2. api_sig is generated by hashing input variables in _alphabatical_ order 
    3. The api_sig that is computed while posting an image to the server, needs to be 
    	tracked as it is used as a unique identifier to fetch the results on that 
    	image in all subsequent calls. 
    4. Each and every api call should have its own unique api_sig.         
    5. The query sends image as HTML multipart POST
